<br>
<ul>
    <li style="width: 50%">Cleanse very gently: Skin that frequently blushes and flushes tends to be fragile. Even your most basic skin care steps
    - in this case, cleansing - should be as gentle and comforting as possible. Massage a mild face wash like Redness
    Solutions Soothing Cleanser into your skin, tissue off or rinse with lukewarm water, and pat dry with a clean towel.
    Enriched with emollients such as squalene and glycerin, this gentle cleanser offers frictionless application to minimise
    any chance of reaction. And remember: avoid fragrance in your cleanser, since itâ€™s one of the most common skin
    irritants. Even though you rinse it off, your skin will still benefit from the ingredients.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Clarins Gentle Exfoliating Toner</h5>

    <li style="width: 50%">Apply Toner:After drying your face with a towel, take out your cotton ball. Pour your toner on the cotton ball until
    damp. Do not over-soak. It drips and turns messy.Tap the ball on your face lightly. Focus on areas you missed with your
    cleansers. Work your cotton ball along your hairline, close to your ears, the corners of your nose, jawline, and under
    your chin. You can pay extra attention to your T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) if you have oily or combination
    skin.Dispose cotton ball. Wait for the toner to dry. Do not rinse off.Move to the next step.</li>
